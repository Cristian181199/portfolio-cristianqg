## Introduction

When I set out to build my personal portfolio and blog, I had a clear vision: create a modern, performant website that would showcase my work while being maintainable and scalable. After evaluating several frameworks, I chose **Astro** for its simplicity, performance, and flexibility.

In this article, I'll walk you through the entire development process, the technologies I used, and the challenges I faced along the way.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Astro 5.x**: The main framework, chosen for its islands architecture and excellent performance
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For styling with a utility-first approach
- **MDX**: For writing blog content with the ability to use React components

### Additional Libraries

- **Resend**: For handling contact form submissions
- **@fontsource**: For self-hosting Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts
- **Astro Sitemap**: For automatic sitemap generation

## Project Structure

The project follows Astro's recommended structure with some custom additions for internationalization:

└── public/
```

## Key Features

### 1. Internationalization (i18n)

One of the most challenging aspects was implementing proper internationalization. I wanted to support three languages: English, Spanish, and German.

#### Solution

I created a custom i18n system using JSON files for translations and utility functions to handle language detection and translation:

```typescript
// src/i18n/utils.ts
export function getLangFromUrl(url: URL) {
  const [, lang] = url.pathname.split('/');
  if (lang in translations) return lang;
  return defaultLang;
}

export function useTranslations(lang: string) {
  return function t(key: string) {
    // Translation logic
  };
}
```

### 2. Theme System

I implemented a dark/light theme system that persists user preferences using localStorage. The system defaults to dark mode and respects user system preferences.

```typescript
const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'dark';
```

### 3. Content Collections

For the blog, I used Astro's Content Collections API with a schema to ensure type safety:

```typescript
const blog = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    lang: z.enum(['en', 'es', 'de']),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
    draft: z.boolean().default(false),
  }),
});
```

### 4. Design System

I created a cohesive design system using CSS custom properties for colors:

- Background Dark: `#18181B`
- Text Light: `#FEF7ED`
- Primary/Accent: `#EA580C`
- Secondary: `#71717A`

The design is minimalist, focusing on readability and user experience. All colors meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards for contrast.

### 5. Responsive Navigation

The header includes a responsive navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices, ensuring a great experience across all screen sizes.

## Portfolio Sections

The homepage is divided into several sections:

1. **Hero**: Introduction with call-to-action buttons
2. **About**: Personal philosophy and approach to work
3. **Projects**: Showcase of key projects with links to repositories
4. **Experience**: Professional timeline with technologies used
5. **Skills**: Categorized technical skills with proficiency levels
6. **Contact**: Form for reaching out (integrates with Resend API)

## Blog Functionality

The blog includes:

- **Search**: Client-side search filtering by title, description, and tags
- **Tags**: Categorization system for organizing posts
- **Reading Time**: Automatic calculation based on word count
- **Multilingual**: Posts can be written in any of the three supported languages
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with proper formatting
- **Draft Mode**: Ability to hide posts from production

## Performance Optimizations

- **Static Site Generation**: All pages are pre-rendered at build time
- **Font Optimization**: Self-hosted fonts to reduce external requests
- **Image Optimization**: Astro's built-in image optimization
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Only essential client-side scripts are loaded

## Deployment Strategy

The site is deployed on my own Hetzner server using Dokploy, which automatically deploys changes from the GitHub repository.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Managing Multilingual Routes

**Problem**: Keeping routes consistent across languages while maintaining SEO.

**Solution**: Created utility functions to generate localized paths and used Astro's routing configuration to handle the default language without a prefix.

### Challenge 2: Theme Flash on Page Load

**Problem**: Brief flash of wrong theme before JavaScript executes.

**Solution**: Inline critical JavaScript in the head to set theme before content renders.

### Challenge 3: Blog Post Language Isolation

**Problem**: Ensuring users only see posts in their selected language.

**Solution**: Filtered blog posts by language in the collection query:

```typescript
const allPosts = await getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => {
  return data.lang === lang && !data.draft;
});
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with Accessibility**: Building with accessibility in mind from the beginning is much easier than retrofitting it later.

2. **Type Safety Matters**: TypeScript caught numerous potential bugs during development.

3. **CSS Variables are Powerful**: Using CSS custom properties made theme switching trivial and maintainable.

4. **Content Collections are Amazing**: Astro's Content Collections API provides excellent developer experience with type safety and validation.

5. **Performance by Default**: Astro's architecture makes it easy to build fast websites without much optimization effort.

## Future Improvements

While the portfolio is functional and meets my current needs, there are several enhancements I'd like to add:

- **RSS Feed**: For blog subscribers
- **Comments System**: To enable discussion on blog posts
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Custom analytics visualization
- **Newsletter Integration**: For notifying subscribers of new posts
- **Dark Mode for Code Blocks**: Better syntax highlighting themes

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio with Astro was an excellent learning experience. The framework's simplicity and performance focus align perfectly with my development philosophy of creating clean, maintainable code.

The combination of Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript provided a solid foundation for building a modern, professional portfolio that's easy to maintain and extend.

If you're considering building your own portfolio, I highly recommend giving Astro a try. Its learning curve is gentle, but it's powerful enough for complex requirements like internationalization and content management.
