    "description": "Hello! I'm Cristian, a passionate back-end developer. My fascination with computer science began at a young age, driven by the desire to someday develop software that people enjoy using. This passion remains my core driver: there's nothing more rewarding for me than turning an idea into a functional product and receiving positive feedback from users. The journey to get there - creatively solving problems, learning from mistakes, and mastering technical challenges - is what excites me every day.",

  "about": {
    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "In my way of working, I follow a structured and thoughtful approach. I systematically break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks to reach a robust solution step by step. I place the utmost importance on code quality. For me, clean, readable, and maintainable software is not an optional extra, but the foundation for lasting and successful projects.\n\nIn teams, I value a balanced mix of intensive collaboration - whether in joint brainstorming or mutual support - and concentrated individual work to master demanding challenges.\n\nFor my professional future, I aspire to develop as a senior developer who not only achieves technical excellence in modern technologies, but can also share their knowledge and guide younger colleagues. I'm looking for an environment that combines interesting challenges and a positive work climate with a healthy work-life balance."
